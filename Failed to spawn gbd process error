Hello,

I have recently downloaded the latest version of Geany on my Maacbook air. I then downloaded and installed the debugger plugin. I already made the right setups for the compile and build function. But when I try to use the debugger it returns me the error: Failed ton spawn gbd process. How to solve this problem. Thank you in advance
